•	Task 01
Q.	Implement an  algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1.	Ask user to input the number n 
2.	Ask user to enter the divisor Nth
3.	Divide n by Nth 
4.	Set the  variable Result to the remainder 
5.	Check if Result is equal to 0 
6.	If yes then display (Nth”is a divisor of ”n) to the user
7.	If no then display (Nth”is not a divisor of ”n) to the user
8.	 Now divide Nth by 2 and set variable Check to its Remainder
9.	If Check is equal to 0, display (Nth is Even) to the user
10.	If Check is not equal to 0, display (Nth is Odd) to the user
